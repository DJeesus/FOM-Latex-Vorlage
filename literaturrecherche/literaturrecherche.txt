	Beschreibung:
	    This paper considers the topic of accelerated testing of cyber-physical systems and software. It compares the testing of these systems to each other and to classical mechanical/electro-mechanical systems. The impact of the software (and combined hardware-software element) on accelerated testing is also considered. A case study is used to examine and illustrate key aspects of cyber-physical system testing. This case study relates to a near worst-case example: a long-duration autonomous spacecraft mission. The paper then discusses one prospective approach for testing software and cyber-physical systems, the use of an autonomous testing system, and discusses the benefits of this approach (including being able to incorporate elements of this system and its knowledge base into an onboard maintenance system) before concluding.

Beschreibung:
    Accelerated stress testing (AST) has been used in electronic, electromechanical, and mechanical systems to achieve robustness with high reliability primarily for hardware. For software products, the reliability program is often conducted separate from any hardware accelerated stress testing. Yet, many systems are consist of concurrent software and hardware issues. In addition, the stress testing processes were primarily adopted by those responsible to develop and manufacture hardware. For example, the stresses usually include temperature extremes, thermal cycles, vibrations, etc. These stresses are effective in accelerating latent hardware defects from degradable, marginal, or intermittent failures to hard failures so that root cause analyses and corrective actions may be made. Although experiments had indicated that software faults and hardware defects are related, the available formulation of the fundamental principles was still based on hardware systems. AST for software and for operating systems have been discussed in [M. Werner, et al., "Improving Customer Satisfaction via Accelerated Stress Testing of General Purpose Computer Operating Systems"] and [M. Werner, et al., 2002], but a fundamental understanding of AST for software is lacking. In order to generalize the fundamentals of accelerated stress testing to address both software and hardware, we need to define accelerated stress testing for software and to address whether they are needed, i.e., whether there are effective methods to achieve high software reliability. The basic reliability concepts categorize systems into different categories according to the presence of defects and faults and whether these weaknesses are explicit enough. The concepts for both hardware and software reliability separate the notion of defects and faults from failures. It further conceptually separates the notion of stressing and the notion of detection. The fundamental concept is that all failures except the explicit ones must be manifested under certain stress conditions. There is then a threshold stress level beyond which a system fails. The cumulative effect of stresses is included by defining time as one type of stress. Both hardware and software systems have marginal weakness, and degradable weakness. The process of recovery and repair are also examined for both hardware and software events. The basic reliability principles in accelerated stress testing for both software and hardware systems are combined and explained in this paper. While [M. Werner, et al., "Improving Customer Satisfaction via Accelerated Stress Testing of General Purpose Computer Operating Systems"] and [M. Werner, et al., 2002] also address the needs and advantages of AST for software, an effective software AST program requires efficient tools yet to be developed. The benefits should justify the needed further research and development in this area.

Beschreibung:
    The stress testing of AI-based systems differs from the approach taken for more traditional Web services, both in terms of the design of test cases and the metrics used to measure quality. The expected variability in responses of an AI-based system to the same request adds a level of complexity to stress testing, when compared to more standard systems where the system response is deterministic and any deviations may easily be characterized as product defects. Generating test cases for AI-based systems requires balancing breadth of test cases with depth of response quality: most AI-systems may not return a perfect answer. An example of a machine learning translation system is considered, and the approach used for stress testing it is presented, alongside comparisons with a more traditional approach. The challenges of shipping such a system to support a growing set of features and language pairs necessitate a mature prioritization of test cases. This approach has been successful in shipping a Web service that currently serves millions of users per day.

Abstract:
    Summary This paper includes the importance of performance testing of web applications and analyses the application's bottleneck based on hardware, software and resource utilization. The main focus of this paper is performance testing based on load test. It has been seen that everyone wants a very fast application, but at the same time, reliability of the application takes an important role; so, customer's satisfaction is the push for performance testing of a given application. Performance testing determines how fast some aspects of the system perform under a pre-defined workload. The performance testing is calculated by analyzing the production, which comes from the application hosted on the server. The main performance is calculated when business is at its peak by its hits.

Abstract:
    Denials of service attacks are well-known as one of the major threats in today's Internet services. Majority VOIP services, DNS servers, online gaming and e-commerce applications are suffering and targeted by hackers using the execution of denial of service attack. Web application attacks and denial of service attacks in distributed architecture is significantly increases day by day. The denial of service attack hampers the load on CPU of web servers during the attack. Therefore, there is a need to minimize the load of CPU after effective attack detection.This paper proposes and implemented denial of service detection framework which consists of packet sniffer, feature extraction, attack detection and output module. The proposed framework detects denial of service attack such as TCP SYN Flood based on threshold and misuse detection. The system is analyzed with the help of CPU load and the load of CPU is minimized after TCP SYN flood attack detection.

Abstract:
    The use of cloud computing services appears to offer significant cost advantages. The most frequently mentioned advantages include investment and operating costs saving, high elasticity of services as well as increased flexibility of certain business processes. On the other hand, the adoption of cloud computing in enterprise environments is non-trivial. Understanding the organizational benefits and drawbacks is far from straightforward. The adoption of cloud computing results in a considerable amount of organizational change that will affect employees. The aim of this contribution is to conduct and describe the evaluation model of cloud computing that would be applicable in business practice for evaluating the effectiveness of such investments. The target users of this model are primarily people in companies with decision-making power in the investment field. The appropriate starting point based on the multi-criteria evaluation was the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) approach for cloud computing (CC). A multi-method approach (systematic literature review, analysis of real cloud computing services, expert interview, case study) was applied in order to develop and evaluate the formal model. We found that our model fits the practical requirements and supports decision-making in cloud computing.
